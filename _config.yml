  Final-year **Software Engineering (Honours)** student at [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/) — graduating Nov 2026 — and a recipient of the **2023 & 2024 Monash Engineering Dean's Honours (Top 3%)**.

  I recently co-founded [AIVA](https://tryaiva.app/) as CTO, building an AI-powered executive assistant platform, and am conducting research at Monash University under [Dr Eunus Ali](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/eunus-ali). I also bring experience as a Full-Stack Developer Intern at [JobSearch.Works](https://www.linkedin.com/company/job-search-works/posts/?feedView=all) and as an IT Analyst at [Coles Group](https://www.linkedin.com/company/colesgroup/posts/?feedView=all).

  I'm passionate about developing web applications that create real-world impact in industry settings. In my free time, I practise kendo, explore the outdoors, and build self-driven software projects.

  I am most skilled in: <mark>Python</mark>, <mark>TypeScript</mark>, <mark>React</mark>, <mark>Angular</mark>, <mark>Firebase</mark>, and <mark>Node.js</mark>

          AI-Powered Personal Executive Assistant for Productivity & Time Management
        description: |
          - Led the end-to-end architecture and development of a full-stack AI assistant platform — building the backend in **Node.js** (Express) with **Supabase** (PostgreSQL) and the mobile client in **Flutter** (iOS) — integrating third-party services including Google Calendar, Notion, and Google Cloud voice APIs to deliver a unified productivity tool.
          - Owned the AI feature pipeline, designing a conversational assistant using **Google Gemini** that autonomously manages calendar scheduling, task prioritisation, and personalised recommendations through long-term memory of user preferences.
          - Directed technical strategy and sprint planning across frontend and backend teams, driving code reviews, API design decisions, and release cycles while coordinating cross-functional collaboration between developers and designers.

          Dynamic Platoon Formation of Multi-Type Autonomous Vehicles for Sustainable Urban Mobility
        description: |
          - Co-authored an [IEEE ITSC](https://ieee-itsc.org/2026/)-targeted research paper with [Dr. Mohammed Eunus Ali](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/eunus-ali), introducing a novel system where smaller Passive Vehicles (PVs) are physically towed by larger Active Vehicles (AVs) on shared highway segments, formulating the platoon formation problem as a constrained optimisation model with multi-segment matching and point-wise capacity constraints.
          - Designed and implemented two matching algorithms — a Greedy Maximum-Weight Matching baseline and an Iterative Linear Assignment (ILA) method using the Jonker–Volgenant solver — achieving 25–52% energy-proportional distance coverage across synthetic scenarios with up to 400 PVs and 80 AVs.
          - Built an end-to-end experimental framework in **Python** (NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Matplotlib) with parameter sweep experiments, automated data pipelines, and comparative visualisation tools for algorithm benchmarking.
